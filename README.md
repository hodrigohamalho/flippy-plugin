flippy-plugin
=============

It is a fork from http://blog.guilhemmarty.com/flippy/ , the original
plugin has a bug when you use rgba colors on div background. And when
you call $(object).flippy(...) the message "Uncaught ReferenceError: g
is not defined" comes up. 

So, this bug was solved here. I expect that author merge this changes so
I can exclude this repository :)
